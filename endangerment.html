                <h1>Key Factors and Effects of Endangerment</h1>
                    <p>There are a multitude of factors that led to the sharp decline in tiger populations globally, but one constant is present among all of them: humans were the root cause. </p>
                    <h2>Poaching</h2>
                        <p>While illegal, poaching still occurs in droves due to the desire for tiger pelts, bones, teeth, and claws.<sup><a href="sources.html#5">[5]</a></sup> These are later sold by poachers on the black market. Illegal poaching occurs in even the most protected areas, making it a major problem.</p>
                    <h2>Habitat Loss and Fragmentation</h2>
                        <p>Habitat loss is up alongside poaching as one of the biggest problems tiger populations have to face. It typically occurs because humans clear away forests for their own development, leading to rapid deforestation and driving tigers away from their natural habitats.<sup><a href="sources.html#5">[5]</a></sup> The lack of space for tigers leads to a vast array of problems, the first of which is prey depletion; tigers are not the only creatures that are suffocated in the smaller territories. The prey they hunt starts to deplete rapidly, directly affecting the well-being of tigers in the area. As tiger populations become more fragmented, the risk of inbreeding also increases as tigers are unable to branch out from their birth areas.</p>
                    <h2>Human-Wildlife Conflict</h2>
                        <p>Tigers are increasingly becoming more likely to come into contact with humans ever since their natural habitats started shrinking.<sup><a href="sources.html#5">[5]</a></sup> This leads to conflicts between them when tigers prey on livestock or attack humans. Humans also indirectly interfere with the day-to-day lives of tigers when they develop large-scale infrastructure projects (such as roads, dams, and mines). Roads give poachers and loggers increased access to the forests. Dams can flood areas or disrupt rivers, and mines cause massive amounts of destruction or pollution.</p>
                    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
                        <p>Changes in the climate, primarily rising temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns, affect tigers in separate ways.<sup><a href="sources.html#5">[5]</a></sup> If a tiger’s ecosystem becomes disrupted due to instability in its climate, this will directly affect the tiger population of that area. Climate change can lead to changes such as a reduction in prey populations, changes in vegetation, and increases in the amount of natural disasters that occur, and the severity of said natural disasters. All of these components combine into terrible sustainability for a tiger-based ecosystem.</p>
                    <h2>Political Issues</h2>
                        <p>In some of the countries where tigers are located, political instability is a real problem that can stand as a hurdle to conservation efforts.<sup><a href="sources.html#5">[5]</a></sup> Without stable laws and regulations, enforcement of conservation laws will not be possible and habitats cannot be protected. Indirectly, conflicts can cause human populations to be displaced, delving further into the native territories of tigers.</p>
                        <p>Despite the existence of laws attempting to protect tigers and their habitats, the low efficacy of these policies coupled with the aforementioned lack of stability leads to no improvement, allowing poachers and illegal traders to continue operating. However, the placement of laws in the first place is a great step in the right direction; now, there just needs to be proper enforcement.</p>
                    <h2>Population Trends</h2>
                        <p>In the early twentieth century, the wild tiger population was estimated to be about 100,000; nowadays, it hovers around a few thousand.<sup><a href="sources.html#7">[7]</a></sup> This is a pure reflection of the factors of endangerment mentioned above. The Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categorizes tigers as endangered, while certain subspecies are categorized as critically endangered and even extinct. Despite some extremely recent population growth patterns, the numbers as a whole are still considered to be declining by the IUCN. The number of tigers in captivity still far exceeds the number of tigers in the wild; in fact, captive tigers in the US alone outnumber those in the wild globally.</p>
                <h1>Conservation Efforts</h1>
                    <h2>Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)</h2>
                        <p>There is a vast array of different NGOs fighting against the decline of tiger populations. Here are three of the most prominent ones.</p>
                        <h3>Wildlife Conservation Society</h3>
                            <p>WCS has been a leader in tiger conservation, part of a group of non-government organizations (NGOs) called the Tiger Conservation Coalition.<sup><a href="sources.html#3">[3]</a></sup> Their goal is to raise over one billion dollars for tiger conservation and awareness efforts over the next 10-12 years.</p>
                        <h3>Global Conservation</h3>
                            <p>Places where tigers once roamed, like Myanmar, China, Laos, and Vietnam, are now empty due to things like poaching; Global Conservation has been focusing on two endangered national parks in Thailand- deploying park defense to protect their two core habitats in Thailand (from hunters, tiger poaching syndicates, illegal logging, deforestation, and killing critical prey).<sup><a href="sources.html#10">[10]</a></sup> Their sights are set on the eastern Thailand forests (Thap Lan National Park), and the western forests (Thung Yai and Huai Kha Khaeng National Parks) which are both UNESCO World Heritage sites. Global Park defense has been deployed by Global Conservation with help from WCS Thailand and the Department of Parks and Wildlife. They use measures like surveillance, communications, smart patrolling, and community protection to protect from illegal logging and land clearing, and their deployment has resulted in significantly less poaching inside the park.</p>
                            <p>As a result of their efforts, tigers have slowly begun to return to the region and new cubs have been sighted. Their story serves as a model for the rest of Asia to follow; national parks need to be protected amidst growing human populations and they serve as the last “bastions” for tiger populations to thrive in.</p>
                        <h3>World Wildlife Fund</h3>
                            <p>The WWF focuses on a wide range of goals for the conservation of tigers.<sup><a href="sources.html#15">[15]</a></sup> They monitor tigers and their prey, employing camera traps and tracking technology to analyze the progress of tiger populations. They work to “build political will, linking tiger conservation with forest preservation, and encouraging tiger range nations to commit to promoting a healthy environmental and economic future.” Lastly, they work alongside many different groups, organizations, and individuals to shut down illegal activities regarding tigers, such as the poaching or trading of their parts. They conduct investigations to document tiger trade and catalyze action against it. According to the WWF, their “effort proved great success as the Global Tiger Forum reported approximately 5,574 wild tigers, reflecting a remarkable 74% increase since the initiative's inception.”</p>
                    <h2>Other Sources of Conservation</h2>
                        <h3>Legal Protection</h3>
                            <p>Here is a list of laws, policies, and acts set in place to protect tigers<sup><a href="sources.html#11">[11]</a></sup>:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) is an international treaty from 1973 to regulate trade in wildlife species, and list the endangerment of those species.</li>
                                <li>IUCN is an NGO that was founded in 1948 and supports the conservation of all animals.</li>
                                <li>The Captive Wildlife Safety Act was passed in 2003 and bans all interstate and foreign commerce of animals such as big cats (tigers, lions, cheetahs, etc.).</li>
                                <li>The Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994 provisions additional financial resources.</li>
                                <li>The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides additional protection since tigers are on the endangered species list.</li>
                                <li>Many legal measures have been taken in India, a key location for tiger populations:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>In 1968, Indira Gandhi became PM and took political leadership in tiger conservation; she prohibited the export of tiger skins and in 1970 banned tiger shooting.</li>
                                        <li>India launched a tiger conservation program named Project Tiger in 1973 with help from the WWF.</li>
                                        <li>They inspired other countries, like Nepal, Thailand, and Indonesia, to launch their own reserves (Russia, the main location of Siberian tiger populations, had already created their own conservation strategies beforehand).</li>
                                        <li>By 1990, 17 tiger reserves had been created in India.</li>
                                        <li>The Forest Conservation Act of 1980 provided legal protection for the forests of India.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        <h3>Economic Incentives</h3>
                            <p>The key motive for providing economic incentives is to provide financial benefits for tiger conservation and make it profitable for local people rather than to hunt and sell them.<sup><a href="sources.html#11">[11]</a></sup> Some technologically advanced nations, such as the US, work to provide this financial assistance to tiger conservation programs. For example, the US government imposed wildlife trade sanctions on Taiwan in 1994 for the illegal trade of tiger and rhino products, setting a precedent for sanctioning countries to impede illegal trade.</p>
                            <p>Ecotourism is another valuable incentive; it promotes both educational and conservation-based opportunities, as well as provides both revenue for conservation projects and jobs for local citizens.</p>
                        <h3>Zoological Parks</h3>
                            <p>Here is a list of tiger conservation projects that are backed by the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund<sup><a href="sources.html#11">[11]</a></sup>:</p>

                            </ol>
                        <h3>Increasing Public Awareness</h3>
                            <p>Unfortunately, many people across the globe are simply unaware of the struggle to keep tiger populations up, and in the long term, public awareness and support will ultimately be the key to tiger conservation. While many people are not aware of the threats that tigers are facing, the goal of conservation organizations around the world is to promote education and outreach efforts to accumulate support for their initiatives. Part of the purpose of this website, Tiger Awareness, is to serve as a direct way to learn about conservation efforts and check out the organizations that are leading the charge.</p>
