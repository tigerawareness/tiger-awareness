            <h1>Why Tigers Matter</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Being apex predators, they regulate the populations of their prey to stop them from destroying the ecosystem. (1)</li>
                    <li>Tigers hold a deep cultural significance in many communities in Asia.</li>
                    <li>Protecting tigers also leads to preserving ecosystems that house many other amazing creatures.</li>
                    <li>Tiger-based ecotourism generates a lot of revenue for local communities, incentivizing conservation efforts over exploitation. (1)</li>
                    <li>The fight to save tigers has catalyzed international cooperation, creating frameworks and technologies that benefit broader conservation efforts worldwide.</li>
                </ul>
            <h1>The Situation is Dire</h1>
                <h2>In only a century, tigers lost 93% of their territory and 96% of their population because of humans. Now, itâ€™s time to right the wrongs of mankind.</h2>
