# Tiger Awareness

## My Purpose

I created this website for a school class in which I get to design, plan, and execute any kind of project of my choosing. I chose to make a static website about tigers, as they are my favorite animal and I had a lot of interest in learning HTML and CSS. My overarching goal in the long-term was to display everything I learned about the coding languages in one website, because that would be a great indicator of how well I absorbed the information and how well I used it to my advantage. As such, I aimed to use a lot of lists, tables, images, etc. to demonstrate both my knowledge of HTML elements, and ability to format them in CSS. 

I chose the topic of tigers because, as a relatively unheard crisis, their rapid decline in population needs to have more attention globally. While this project won't necessarily reach all the corners of the Earth, even informing a few people about their situation could make some degree of a difference. As such, the entire website is themed around awareness; I attempted to teach about both the animal itself, and about its endangerment and struggle to stay as a species of the planet.

Ultimately, the project itself was about learning how to code a website. The quality of the website itself is supposed to be the main focus point; but in the process of judging the website as a reader, I hope that you get to learn a little about the fight for tiger conservation!
